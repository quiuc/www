# About QUIUC

QUIUC was started in Spring 2019 to establish a community of students, faculty, and
industry professionals with a combined interest in the future potentials of quantum
computing to reshape our world. With the advent of the [IQUIST](https://iquist.illinois.edu),
the University of Illinois made it clear they are supporting research in the field,
however there still remained a gap for undergraduates to get involved or even just learn
what the hottest buzzword in science was even all about. This is what QUIUC is meant
to fulfill and supplement.

&nbsp;

As a Special Interest Group (SIG) under the [UIUC ACM Chapter](https://acm.illinois.edu), we are open to and have a place for students from any background or skill level. Aside from our educational workshops and research
projects teams, we are working to bring in academic and industry professionals
interested in giving tech talks, collaborating with our groups, or supporting our
end mission.
