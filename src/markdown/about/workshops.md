# Educational Workshops

<!-- Within QUIUC, we develop and put on educational workshops with the goal of building
up our members with enough knowledge to work on future research projects. We cater
to two different paths: crash courses and topic groups.
 -->

Currently, in-person workshops have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual workshops are in the works, though, so stay tuned!

The crash course series focuses on solidifying the introductory and pre-requisite material for those new
to the field. This series covers introductory quantum physics such as superposition,
teleportation, and quantum logic gates (to name a few), as well as the requisite
math and Python needed to work on these problems. All of the crash courses include
hand-on demos or code samples, as well as problem sets for those that want extra
practice.

&nbsp;

The topic groups section is targeted towards more experienced members
and is more open-ended. The model is simple: anyone that has taken a deep dive
into a specific topic (i.e. worked on a project surrounding it) and wants to
share what they learned can put on a session. The session would consist of a
presentation to the topic, and an informal group discussion about it. The goal
of topic groups is to brain storm ideas for new research projects, and explore
the tools available for these.
