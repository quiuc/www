# Quantum Computing Course

At QUIUC, prior experience is never a limitation for those willing to learn. Through self-paced courses provided through ACM and hosted by [qBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/), we aim to provide introductory Quantum Computing knowledge to all UIUC students interested in the field. Currently, there are two courses offered: an introductory course ("QuBes") that introduces students to the physics and math involved with quantum computing as well as an intermediate course ("QuInts") which offers a more detailed understanding of quantum computing concepts. Both courses are hosted in cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks, providing students access to real IBM quantum hardware to run their code on.

&nbsp;

### QuBes - an introduction to Quantum Computing for everyone

The introductory QuBes course explores the tools required for exploring the world of classical computing and follows up with introductory quantum computing concepts. The QuBes course covers the following topics:

-   An Informal introduction to quantum mechanics
-   Basics of classical computing, including basics of Python
-   Basics of complex numbers and linear algebra
-   Introduction to qubits, quantum gates and quantum programming
-   Simple quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm, BB84
-   Entanglement and non-local games

&nbsp;

### QuInts - Quantum Computing crash course for those with some mathematical background

The QuInts course provides a more rigorous look at content presented in the QuBes course, providing a fast-paced alternative to QuBes. Assuming the student's knowledge in basic prerequisites such as Python, linear algebra, and other mathematical concepts, this course is designed to take the student from zero quantum computing experience to a rigorous understanding of some famous algorithms and protocols in quantum computing.
