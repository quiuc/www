{"data":{"allMarkdownRemark":{"nodes":[{"html":"<h1>About QUIUC</h1>\n<p>QUIUC was started in Spring 2019 to establish a community of students, faculty, and\nindustry professionals with a combined interest in the future potentials of quantum\ncomputing to reshape our world. With the advent of the <a href=\"https://iquist.illinois.edu\">IQUIST</a>,\nthe University of Illinois made it clear they are supporting research in the field,\nhowever there still remained a gap for undergraduates to get involved or even just learn\nwhat the hottest buzzword in science was even all about. This is what QUIUC is meant\nto fulfill and supplement.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As a Special Interest Group (SIG) under the <a href=\"https://acm.illinois.edu\">UIUC ACM Chapter</a>, we are open to and have a place for students from any background or skill level. Aside from our educational workshops and research\nprojects teams, we are working to bring in academic and industry professionals\ninterested in giving tech talks, collaborating with our groups, or supporting our\nend mission.</p>\n<p> </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about-0"}},{"html":"<h1>Quantum Computing Course</h1>\n<p>At QUIUC, prior experience is never a limitation for those willing to learn. Through self-paced courses provided through ACM and hosted by <a href=\"https://www.qbraid.com/\">qBraid</a>, we aim to provide introductory Quantum Computing knowledge to all UIUC students interested in the field. Currently, there are two courses offered: an introductory course (\"QuBes\") that introduces students to the physics and math involved with quantum computing as well as an intermediate course (\"QuInts\") which offers a more detailed understanding of quantum computing concepts. Both courses are hosted in cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks, providing students access to real IBM quantum hardware to run their code on.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>QuBes - an introduction to Quantum Computing for everyone</h3>\n<p>The introductory QuBes course explores the tools required for exploring the world of classical computing and follows up with introductory quantum computing concepts. The QuBes course covers the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Informal introduction to quantum mechanics</li>\n<li>Basics of classical computing, including basics of Python</li>\n<li>Basics of complex numbers and linear algebra</li>\n<li>Introduction to qubits, quantum gates and quantum programming</li>\n<li>Simple quantum algorithms: Deutsch's algorithm, BB84</li>\n<li>Entanglement and non-local games</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>QuInts - Quantum Computing crash course for those with some mathematical background</h3>\n<p>The QuInts course provides a more rigorous look at content presented in the QuBes course, providing a fast-paced alternative to QuBes. Assuming the student's knowledge in basic prerequisites such as Python, linear algebra, and other mathematical concepts, this course is designed to take the student from zero quantum computing experience to a rigorous understanding of some famous algorithms and protocols in quantum computing.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Contact us on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/PmaXeHPaFs\">discord</a> to sign up for these courses!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about-1"}},{"html":"<h1>Educational Workshops</h1>\n<!-- Within QUIUC, we develop and put on educational workshops with the goal of building\nup our members with enough knowledge to work on future research projects. We cater\nto two different paths: crash courses and topic groups.\n -->\n<p>Currently, in-person workshops have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual workshops are in the works, though, so stay tuned!</p>\n<!--\n&nbsp;\n\nThe crash course series focuses on solidifying the introductory and pre-requisite material for those new\nto the field. This series covers introductory quantum physics such as superposition,\nteleportation, and quantum logic gates (to name a few), as well as the requisite\nmath and Python needed to work on these problems. All of the crash courses include\nhand-on demos or code samples, as well as problem sets for those that want extra\npractice.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe topic groups section is targeted towards more experienced members\nand is more open-ended. The model is simple: anyone that has taken a deep dive\ninto a specific topic (i.e. worked on a project surrounding it) and wants to\nshare what they learned can put on a session. The session would consist of a\npresentation to the topic, and an informal group discussion about it. The goal\nof topic groups is to brain storm ideas for new research projects, and explore\nthe tools available for these.\n -->","frontmatter":{"title":"about-2"}},{"html":"<h1>Research Projects</h1>\n<p>In tandem with our educational workshops we support project teams interested in\ndiving into learning more about an area through experience. Example project ideas\ninclude building out a simple quantum simulator, implementing algorithms on\nquantum frameworks (i.e. IBM Q Experience, Google CIRQ), and any other projects\nthat members pitch. As an organization we do not dictate the projects people work\non; it's whatever you and your peers want to delve into! Instead QUIUC will try\nto be a resource to those projects through infrastructure, seeking out faculty\nmentors, or connecting that project with industry.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"about-3"}}]}}}
