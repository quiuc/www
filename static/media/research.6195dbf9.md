# Research Projects

In tandem with our educational workshops we support project teams interested in
diving into learning more about an area through experience. Example project ideas
include building out a simple quantum simulator, implementing algorithms on
quantum frameworks (i.e. IBM Q Experience, Google CIRQ), and any other projects
that members pitch. As an organization we do not dictate the projects people work
on; it's whatever you and your peers want to delve into! Instead QUIUC will try
to be a resource to those projects through infrastructure, seeking out faculty
mentors, or connecting that project with industry.
